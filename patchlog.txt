|Subject: [PATCH] ddraw: Implement Pick() and GetPickRecords().
|
|Implement functions used by some games (notably LEGO Island) for
|determining which 3D object in a scene was clicked by the mouse cursor.
|Fighting Steel also uses this function for mouse over. Previous stubs
|would cause LEGO Island to crash upon any click and Fighting Steel
|to crash on game start. A patch posted years ago on the bug thread
|provided the minimum functionality to prevent crashes, but still
|rendered large portions of the game inaccessible without them
|implemented correctly.
|
|Picking has been implemented by adding a "pick mode" in
|d3d_execute_buffer_execute() which skips any drawing functions
|leaving just the vertex processing. Adds click tests for each triangle
|when in pick mode for creating an array of D3DPICKRECORDs.
|
|Stress testing reveals this patch's Pick() implementation may have
|slight inaccuracies to the original function; occasionally pixels right
|on triangle edges result in successful picks when they don't with the
|original function (and vice versa). It may be some sort of floating
|point rounding error or other algorithm difference that would be
|difficult to determine without seeing the original code. In practice, I
|believe this inaccuracy is so negligible that it won't produce any
|undesirable results for the user.

|X11 keycodes are just Linux keycodes + 8 nowadays according to evdev or

| Inquisition
|
|user32: [GAMEFIX] 1/2 Dragon Age Inquisition: fix xinput support
|
|https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47070
|
|I'm not completely sure on the specifics of why the bug happens,
|but there are two main threads involved. Thread A owns the window
|object for the game. Thread B makes all the calls to XInputGetState.
|However, Thread B checks if the window has focus to receive keyboard
|inputs every frame. Thread B calls AttachThreadInput to attach its
|message queue to the Thread A's window a few times before the bug
|starts occurring along with one separate time at the start where
|Thread A attaches Thread B's message queue to the window as well.
|The message queue is detached one last time and then Thread B no
|longer has access to the window.
|
|My workaround checks GetFocus for when it starts receiving Null
|for a response (meaning it does not have access to a window anymore).
|Prior to this, AttachThreadInput stores the IDs of the two threads
|which call the function the very first time (hopefully this works
|with the EA App as I've been debugging this with Origin which doesn't
|seem to call either of the two WINAPI functions as long as you load
|straight into the game from the Origin library menu). When GetFocus
|realizes it does not have a window for the thread, it calls
|AttachThreadInput with the two thread IDs. This allows Thread B to
|access the window, which let's GetFocus return the proper window
|handle, which then let's the program access XInputGetState meaning
|the controller finally works.
|
|Anyway, as far as the final cause of the bug: it might be because
|of thread prioritization causing Thread B to AttachThreadInput to
|be called by it last as the only time Thread A calls it, it does
|not detach the message queue afterwards. This leads me to believe
|that the bug might just be caused by incomplete wine
|functionality / stubs. Although, this part is speculation.

|
|To support VK_NV_low_latency2 a frame ID should be provided for each
|call to vkQueueSubmit. This commit adds a path for fshack to provide
|a frame ID when it submits its upscaling work, when low latency mode
|is enabled.
